    - What are we learning?

        - Web Development.
            - Web application. <-- A combination of client-side (browser) program and a server program.
        - Javascript. (Fullstack)
            - Client-side (browser) Javascript is the only option to building client-side programs.
            - Server-side -- you can pick any language, but we'll learn Javascript here.
            
        Javascript Fundamentals
            - Functions
            - Loops
            - Objects
                - Prototype
            - Data types - strings, booleans, numbers, Symbols, undefined, null
            - Arrays

        "Practice is power."

    - What are our daily practices?

        - **Cohort Library Repo**

        - Lectures:
            - Slide decks, code demos, Q&A.
            - These may go over calendar time, but we try to keep them efficient!
            - Use #2201-ghp-help-and-feedback participation thread to interact and ask text questions.
            - All recordings and lecture materials will appear in your cohort library repo on Github.

        - Morning Reviews:
            - At the end of each day, an "exit ticket" will be shared with you with some essential questions regarding
              the day's material in the form of a short multiple choice quiz.
            - Please fill this survey out each day after class, it should take 5-15 minutes depending.
            - Instructors will review the ticket and/or the main concepts of the previous day of learning from 9:30-10:00am
              each morning (unless it is not on the calendar).

        - Labs:
            - Learning resources available via LMS (learn.fullstack...) that you work on SOLO.
            - These will typically have a lot of hints and solutions to open up, and be more basic
              than the workshops (pair exercises).
            - It is expected AND okay that you typically do not reach the end of these.

        - Workshops:
            - Learning resources available via LMS (learn.fullstack...) that you work on WITH ANOTHER STUDENT (pair).
            - These will sometimes have hints and solutions to open up, which you should only rely on once you have both:
                - Struggled with the problem
                - Reached out to instructors for help (via help desk)
            - It is expected AND okay that you typically do not reach the end of these. This does not include the extra credit
              or bonus sections.
                - The most important takeaways are established and practiced in the first few/several sections.
